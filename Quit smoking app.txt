an app where when you get a craving for a cigarette you can click i have a craving or set timers / reminders 
where when prompted a number of craving killing activities or things you can do will be presented based on the severity

the user needs to be able to log in -> display welcome message
once logged in there will be a buttton which will say i have a craving -> when cliked user will be asked to input the amount of days without smoking 

based on this input value the user will be given a few ideas to elivate this craving 

the app should also advise the user of certain things they should try to avoid for the time being.

the app needs to have a way to schedule reminders and have them be persistent so if the user closes the page / app it will still know when to remind the user. 

the app needs to give motivational and congratualtory statements for certain events and milestones.

---------------------

//HOPEFULLY

the app should potentially track the number of days that the user has been without a cigarette to help them keep track of progress

there should be a way to reset this in case of a relapse

there should potentially be some kind of reward to incentivise users to keep pushing on // although this would likely cost a ton of money and im not sure how i could tackle this without
any spending


----------------------------------------
MINI VERSION

one option is to have the app simply have a button that you can press that will give you things to do and things to avoid to manage the craving


The user should input their number of days without smoking 
then the inputted number needs to be taken and stored
the container needs to be emptied
then html needs to be adjacently pushed with 4 total html bars with 2 things to help and 2 things to avoid as well as a dynamic message based on the number of days
There also needs to be a get more options button pushed that when clicked will refresh the options given and give some new ones
there also needs to be a way for the user to specify if they feel they need more hardcore solutions or some simple fixes that will then present them some new options from the relevant tier
